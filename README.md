The app's main feature is displaying a list of news articles, each with a title, image, and brief description. Users can scroll through the list of articles and tap on an article to view more details. The app uses the Jetpack Compose UI toolkit to build the UI and it uses the coil library to load images. The app fetches data from a remote server using Retrofit library and demonstrates how to use the Jetpack Compose UI toolkit for Android development.
